Hello, I am Mykhailo, but you can call me Mike.

💼 I have two years of experience in Data Analytics and Data Scrapping. I have worked for some of the biggest corporations in the world. At some point, I had three jobs at the same time. I was finishing my internship as a Power BI Analyst, starting another job as a Data Analyst, and collecting data through Data Parsing as a freelancer. As you can see, I love data, but there is something else you need to know about me - I hate scammers!

🎯 I am currently working on my biggest project so far. I want to create a website that will help users around the globe avoid fraudulent platforms. My plan has four stages:
1) Collect data using Web Scrapping libraries in Python. - Complete
2) Publish data on the platforms I have collected in the last two years and find associates who want to help with this project.
3) Using data train ML that will help users detect potential suspicious websites. Transform into a browser extension.
4) Educate the seniors and minors on the topic in a fun and engaging way.

Anyway, what am I doing here? Well, I want to get more experience for this project. I have recently moved to the United States due to the Russian war against my homeland - Ukraine. I had to leave my career at Nestle, and now I am in search of new opportunities.

👨‍💻 I can scrap data for you or provide data analysis with visualizations. I have also shared some of my scrapping codes on my GitHub.
Here are some of the tools I love using:
1) 🐍 Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, BeautifulSoup, Selenium) - Absolutely my favorite!
2) 🗃 SQL, Excel - Irreplaceable.
3) 📊 Power BI, Tableau - I prefer Power BI but have some experience in both.
4) 🧱 Git, Azure
